<pre>
	the divisor is increased 1 at a time. after 3 i can increase by 2. if a number is divisible by any even number, it will be divisible by 2.

	step-1: Any number will not be divisible by a number bigger than half of it. for example, 13 will never be divisible by 7, 8, 9 .. it could be as big as half of it for even number. for example, 16 will be divisible by 8 but will never be by 9, 10, 11, 12...
	Decision: a number will never be divisible by a number bigger than half of its values. So, we dont have to loop 50%
	
	step-2: Now, if a number is not divisible by 3. (if it is divisible by 3, then it wouldn't be a prime number). then it would be divisible any number bigger than the 1/3 of its value. for example, 35 is not divisible by 3. hence it will be never divisible by any number bigger than 35/3 will never be divisible by 12, 13, 14 ... if you take an even number like 36 it will never be divisible by 13, 14, 15
	Decision: a number could be divisible by numbers 1/3 of its value.
	
	step-3: For example u have the number 127. 127 is not divisible by 2 hence you should check upto 63.5. Secondly, 127 is not divisible by 3. So, you will check up to 127/3 approximately 42. It is not divisible by 5, divisor should be less than 127/5 approximately 25 not by 7. So, where should we stop?
	Decision: divisor would be less than Math.sqrt (n)

{
  var divisor = 3, 
      limit = Math.sqrt(n);
  
  //check simple cases
  if (n == 2 || n == 3)
     return true;
  if (n % 2 == 0)
     return false;

  while (divisor <= limit)
  {
    if (n % divisor == 0)
      return false;
    else
      divisor += 2;
  }
  return true;
}

> isPrime(137);
  = true
> isPrime(237);
  = false
